# Presentation: Bosonization in 1+1D and the Sine-Gordon Model

This repository contains the slides for a group meeting presentation delivered at the National Taiwan University (NTU) Department of Physics by YUN-YEN, WU.

## Abstract

This presentation provides an overview of the bosonization procedure in 1+1 dimensions. It begins with the quantization of free massless bosonic and fermionic theories, both of which are Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) with a central charge $c=1$.

The core of the presentation demonstrates how to establish the correspondence between fermionic and bosonic fields (the bosonization identity) by comparing their respective correlation functions.

This technique is then applied to two well-known models:
1.  **Massless Thirring Model**: Shown to be equivalent to a free bosonic theory.
2.  **Sine-Gordon Model**: Derived from a massive fermionic model, where the fermion is identified as a soliton or "kink" in the Sine-Gordon potential.

Finally, the presentation briefly explores the bosonization of a Sine-Gordon model with a non-Hermitian mass term and provides an outlook on calculating its correlation functions, particularly at an exceptional point.
